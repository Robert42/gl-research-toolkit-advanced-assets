# bunny.blend & bunny_imported.blend

This model was originally scanned by the Stanford University Computer Graphics
Laboratory (see their [website](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) for
more information about the scan process).

2016-04-27, Robert Hildebrandt imported the bunny model from bun_zipper.ply into
the Blender file bunny.blend, transformed it to the blender coordinate system,
filled the hole, retopologized the mesh and created a simple uvmap.

>These files are the result of reconstructing a set of range images

>necessarily preserve mesh topology.  While they are not beautiful,
>they are suitable for interactive rendering.
